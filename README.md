# Comprehensive ML Pipeline on Heart Disease UCI Dataset

## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for the Heart Disease UCI dataset. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, supervised and unsupervised learning, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment.

## Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmmarYasserAI-2/Comprehensive-ML-Full-Pipeline-on-Heart-Disease-UCI-Dataset.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Comprehensive-ML-Full-Pipeline-on-Heart-Disease-UCI-Dataset
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 2. Running the Notebooks
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Navigate to the `notebooks` folder and execute the notebooks in sequence:
   - `01_data_preprocessing.ipynb`
   - `02_pca_analysis.ipynb`
   - `03_feature_selection.ipynb`
   - `04_supervised_learning.ipynb`
   - `05_unsupervised_learning.ipynb`
   - `06_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb`

### 3. Model Deployment
1. Run the `ui/app.py` file to start the interactive UI:
   ```bash
   python ui/app.py
   ```

## Deliverables
